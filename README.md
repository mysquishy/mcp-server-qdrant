Note: You cannot provide both `QDRANT_URL` and `QDRANT_LOCAL_PATH` at the same time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Command-line arguments are not supported anymore! Please use environment variables for all configuration.

## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

When using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) no specific installation is needed to directly run *mcp-server-qdrant*.

```shell
uv run mcp-server-qdrant \
  --qdrant-url "http://localhost:6333" \
  --qdrant-api-key "your_api_key" \
  --collection-name "my_collection" \
  --embedding-model "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
```

### Installing via Smithery

To install Qdrant MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/protocol/mcp-server-qdrant):

```bash
npx @smithery/cli install mcp-server-qdrant --client claude
```

## Usage with Claude Desktop

To use this server with the Claude Desktop app, add the following configuration to the "mcpServers" section of your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "qdrant": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "mcp-server-qdrant",
      "--qdrant-url",
      "http://localhost:6333",
      "--qdrant-api-key",
      "your_api_key",
      "--collection-name",
      "your_collection_name"
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `http://localhost:6333`, `your_api_key` and `your_collection_name` with your Qdrant server URL, Qdrant API key
and collection name, respectively. The use of API key is optional, but recommended for security reasons, and depends on
the Qdrant server configuration.

This MCP server will automatically create a collection with the specified name if it doesn't exist.

By default, the server will use the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model to encode memories.
For the time being, only [FastEmbed](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/) models are supported, and you can change it
by passing the `--embedding-model` argument to the server.

## Use Cases

### Document Management and Retrieval

Use the document processing tools to index and search through your documents:

```bash
# Indexing documents for future search
QDRANT_URL="http://localhost:6333" \
COLLECTION_NAME="documents" \
uvx mcp-server-qdrant
```

The MCP server will help with:
- Processing and chunking documents from various sources
- Extracting text, tables, and images from PDFs
- Performing semantic searches across your document collection
- Finding relevant information based on natural language queries

### Vector Database Management

Use the collection and analytics tools to manage your vector database:

```bash
# Vector database management setup
QDRANT_URL="http://localhost:6333" \
COLLECTION_NAME="vectors" \
uvx mcp-server-qdrant
```

This setup provides:
- Collection creation and migration capabilities
- Performance benchmarking for optimizing queries
- Schema and vector statistics for collection analysis
- Data processing tools for working with vectors

### Knowledge Base and FAQ System

Build a knowledge base system using the semantic routing and hybrid search capabilities:

```bash
# Knowledge base setup
QDRANT_URL="http://localhost:6333" \
COLLECTION_NAME="knowledge-base" \
uvx mcp-server-qdrant
```

Features for this use case:
- Store facts, articles, and information with metadata
- Use semantic routing to direct queries to the right knowledge domain
- Hybrid search for better accuracy on technical terms
- Query decomposition for complex questions

## Local Mode of Qdrant

To use a local mode of Qdrant, you can specify the path to the database using the `--qdrant-local-path` argument:

```json
{
  "qdrant": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "mcp-server-qdrant",
      "--qdrant-local-path",
      "/path/to/qdrant/database",
      "--collection-name",
      "your_collection_name"
    ]
  }
}
```

It will run Qdrant local mode inside the same process as the MCP server. Although it is not recommended for production.

### Testing `mcp-server-qdrant` locally

The [MCP inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) is a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP
servers. It runs both a client UI (default port 5173) and an MCP proxy server (default port 3000). Open the client UI in
your browser to use the inspector.

```shell
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run mcp-server-qdrant \
  --collection-name test \
  --qdrant-local-path /tmp/qdrant-local-test
```

Once started, open your browser to http://localhost:5173 to access the inspector interface.
