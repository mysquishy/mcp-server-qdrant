# Qdrant MCP Server - Summary and Next Steps

## What We Accomplished

1. **Diagnosed and Fixed MCP Version Compatibility Issues**
   - Identified that the codebase was written for MCP 0.9.1 but was running with MCP 1.4.1
   - Updated the pyproject.toml file to specify the newer version
   - Fixed import paths for the Context class

2. **Fixed Tool Registration Approach**
   - Changed from using `@mcp.tool()` decorators to `@fast_mcp.tool()`
   - Created a proper FastMCP instance to handle tool registration

3. **Created a Simplified Working Version**
   - Built a minimal MCP server (simple_mcp_server.py) that successfully connects to Qdrant
   - Implemented two basic tools: "remember" and "recall"
   - Properly configured the Claude Desktop integration

4. **Added Debugging and Improved Error Handling**
   - Added detailed logging throughout the initialization process
   - Created debugging scripts to help identify communication issues

5. **Implemented Advanced Search Tools**
   - Created an enhanced server (enhanced_mcp_server.py) with advanced functionality
   - Added nlq_search: Semantic search with customizable filters
   - Added hybrid_search: Combined vector and keyword matching
   - Added multi_vector_search: Search with multiple weighted queries
   - Added analyze_collection: Get stats and schema information about collections
   - Ensured compatibility with existing codebase structures

## Next Steps

### 1. Continue Incorporating Full Functionality

We've made significant progress by implementing the advanced search tools. Let's continue with:

- [x] Add the advanced search tools (hybrid search, multi-vector search)
- [x] Add basic analytics tools (analyze_collection)
- [ ] Add the collection management tools
- [ ] Add the data processing tools
- [ ] Add the document processing tools

For each set of tools, we should:
1. Add them to the enhanced_mcp_server.py
2. Test thoroughly to ensure they work with Claude Desktop
3. Move on to the next set of tools only after confirming success

### 2. Fix the Original Server Implementation

Once we have a better understanding of what works, we should fix the full server implementation:

- [ ] Ensure all imports are compatible with MCP 1.4.1
- [ ] Fix the asyncio handling to avoid the "Already running asyncio in this thread" error
- [ ] Update the QdrantSettings usage pattern to avoid validation errors
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

### 3. Improve Documentation

- [ ] Document the supported MCP SDK versions
- [ ] Create a proper troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add examples of using each tool type with Claude

### 4. Enhance Configuration Options

- [ ] Make the server more configurable through environment variables
- [ ] Improve Claude Desktop integration with better defaults
- [ ] Add support for secure connections to Qdrant (HTTPS, authentication)

### 5. Testing

- [ ] Create automated tests for each tool
- [ ] Add integration tests with an actual Qdrant instance
- [ ] Test edge cases like network failures, large documents, etc.

## Getting Started for Next Session

1. **Start the Qdrant server**:
   ```bash
   # If using Docker:
   docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
   
   # Or if using a local installation:
   qdrant
   ```

2. **Install the package in development mode**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/squishy64/mcp-server-qdrant
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Start the enhanced MCP server**:
   ```bash
   python enhanced_mcp_server.py
   ```

4. **Open Claude Desktop** and test the new tools to verify functionality

5. **Continue adding additional tool sets** to the enhanced_mcp_server.py file

## Understanding the Code Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **src/mcp_server_qdrant/**: Main package directory
  - **server.py**: Main entry point and tool registration
  - **qdrant.py**: Connector to the Qdrant database
  - **embeddings/**: Embedding providers for vector creation
  - **settings.py**: Configuration classes
  - **tools/**: All the custom tools organized by category

The most important files to focus on next are:

1. **enhanced_mcp_server.py**: Our new implementation with advanced tools
2. **src/mcp_server_qdrant/tools/**: To understand and incorporate the remaining tools
3. **src/mcp_server_qdrant/qdrant.py**: Core vector database interaction

## Technical Details for Reference

### MCP Protocol Communication

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables communication between Claude and external tools. The key parts:

- **Tool Registration**: Defining tools that Claude can use
- **Lifespan Management**: Setting up and tearing down resources
- **Message Exchange**: JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout

### Qdrant Vector Database

Qdrant stores embeddings that enable semantic search:

- **Collections**: Organize vector data (we're using "claude-test")
- **Points**: Individual vector entries with payload data
- **Embeddings**: Vector representations of text created by models

### FastEmbed Integration

We're using FastEmbed with the "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model to create embeddings.

### New Tools Implementation

The new tools we've implemented build on the existing infrastructure:

- **Natural Language Query**: Enhanced semantic search with filter support
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines vector search with keyword matching
- **Multi-Vector Search**: Allows weighted combination of multiple queries
- **Collection Analyzer**: Provides statistics and schema information

For the next session, we'll focus on implementing the collection management tools and data processing tools.
