# MCP Server Qdrant - Changes Summary

## Issue Resolution

The main issue with the server was an unresolved Git conflict in the `server.py` file. The conflict represented two different implementations of the server:
1. The "Updated upstream" version with a simpler implementation
2. The "Stashed changes" version with more advanced features

We chose to proceed with the more advanced "Stashed changes" version, which included additional features and tools.

## Changes Made

### 1. Resolved Git Conflict in server.py

- Resolved the Git conflict markers
- Used the newer implementation that includes more advanced tools
- Added missing imports for Context and other types
- Fixed the server implementation to use the new tool-based approach

### 2. Created Missing Type Definition

- Created the `embeddings/types.py` file 
- Added `EmbeddingProviderType` enum to support the types referenced in settings.py
- Added additional type aliases for consistency

### 3. Updated Qdrant Connector Implementation

- Added `Entry` dataclass to represent entries in Qdrant
- Added `Metadata` type alias for entry metadata
- Added new methods to support the updated server implementation:
  - `store` method for storing entries with metadata
  - `search` method that returns Entry objects instead of just strings
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy methods

### 4. Updated Embeddings Package

- Updated `__init__.py` to include the new types
- Modified `factory.py` to use the new `EmbeddingProviderType` enum

### 5. Verified Tool Implementations

- Confirmed that the tool implementations referenced in `server.py` exist
- Verified the implementations are compatible with the updated server

### 6. Updated Dependencies

- Added new dependencies to `pyproject.toml`:
  - `pydantic` and `pydantic-settings` for configuration
  - `httpx` for HTTP requests in tool implementations
  - `numpy` for vector operations

## Next Steps

1. **Run extensive tests** to ensure all the tools work properly
2. **Update documentation** to reflect the new features and tools
3. **Consider modifying the `main` function** in `server.py` to simplify the implementation
4. **Check for any missed dependencies** that might be needed by the various tools

The server should now be able to run without the Git conflict errors, and it includes all the advanced features that were present in the stashed changes version.
