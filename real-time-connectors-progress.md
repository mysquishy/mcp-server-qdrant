# Real-Time Data Connectors Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document summarizes the progress on implementing real-time data connectors for the Qdrant MCP server. These connectors enable the automatic collection and indexing of content from external sources such as Twitter, Mastodon, and RSS feeds.

## Current Status

- **RSS Connector**: Fully implemented
- **Twitter Connector**: ~90% complete
- **Mastodon Connector**: Not started

## Twitter Connector Implementation

### Completed Components

- Core structure for the Twitter connector
- API and web scraping methods for fetching tweets
  - Primary API method for when API keys are available
  - Fallback web scraping method using Nitter for when API keys are not available
- Functions for processing and storing tweets in Qdrant
- Support for handling media attachments and metrics
- Configuration options for handling retweets and replies
- Initial tweet fetching and processing

### Remaining Tasks

1. Complete the `check_twitter_updates` function
   - Properly handle the fetching and processing of new tweets
   - Implement error handling for API rate limits and network issues

2. Implement the `list_twitter_connectors` function
   - Create placeholder implementation returning an empty list
   - Document that a real implementation would use persistent storage

3. Test for edge cases and bugs
   - Handle scenarios like deleted tweets, protected accounts, etc.

## Mastodon Connector Implementation

The Mastodon connector needs to be created from scratch with similar functionality to the Twitter connector, but adapted for Mastodon's API and features.

### Required Components

1. Core setup function
   - Configure instance URL, user to monitor, and other settings
   - Support for both authenticated and unauthenticated API access

2. Fetching methods
   - API methods for retrieving posts from accounts
   - Support for local and federated timelines
   - Handling of content warnings and visibility settings

3. Processing functions
   - Parse Mastodon-specific content formats (mentions, hashtags, etc.)
   - Handle media attachments (images, videos, audio)
   - Process metadata like favorites, boosts, and replies

4. Update checking
   - Implement efficient checks for new posts
   - Respect API rate limits

## Integration with MCP Server

After implementing both connectors, we need to:

1. Register the tools in the enhanced_mcp_server.py file
2. Add proper documentation and examples
3. Update the dependencies in pyproject.toml to include the required packages
4. Create helper functions for common operations

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these design principles:

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Each connector works with or without API keys
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network issues and API limitations
3. **Metadata Enrichment**: Store rich metadata with each piece of content
4. **Configurability**: Extensive configuration options for customized behavior
5. **Progress Reporting**: Clear logging and progress updates during operations

## Next Steps

In the next session, we will:

1. Complete the Twitter connector implementation
2. Create the Mastodon connector with similar functionality
3. Register both connectors in the MCP server
4. Add documentation and usage examples

## Dependencies

Both connectors require the following packages:

```
httpx: For async HTTP requests
beautifulsoup4: For web scraping
```

The Mastodon connector will additionally require:

```
mastodon.py: Python wrapper for the Mastodon API
```

## Notes for Implementation

- Consider using a persistent storage mechanism for connector configurations
- Implement background tasks for periodic updates
- Add support for filtering content based on keywords or patterns
- Consider adding sentiment analysis for retrieved content
